# copilot-money-api

Unofficial CLI + API client for Copilot Money.

## Goals

- Script common workflows (review, categorize, recurring rules) safely.
- Output in `json` and nicely formatted terminal tables.
- Prefer direct API calls (no browser) once the GraphQL surface is mapped.

## Status

Scaffold only (no API calls yet).
